		<p>Chances are, if you've tried to launch Minecraft 1.2.1, you've seen this screen. How do you fix this?
		Well, there are a few options. The actual error is caused by older versions of Minecraft trying to load the options.txt file that was made by modern versions.</p>
		<p>Comparison between old and new options.txt. New is on the left:</p>

		<p>Ok, so how do you fix it? You can either rename options.txt to options_new.txt and launch the game. When you want to play new versions rename the one 1.2.1 made to options_old.txt and rename options_new.txt to options.txt and vice versa.</p>
		<p>The second options is to use <a href=https://multimc.org/>MultiMC</a> and make its own instance, and thus its own options.txt. You can download the official MultiMC instance on the <a href=../downloads.html>downloads page</a>.</p>
